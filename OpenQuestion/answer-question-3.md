# When will we use section, article tags?

1. **`<section>` Tag**:
   - The `<section>` tag is used to group related content thematically within a document.
   - It represents a standalone section of content that has its own heading or topic.
   - Use `<section>` when you want to organize content into distinct blocks or sections.
   - Examples of appropriate use:
     - Dividing a long article into different sections (e.g., introduction, body, conclusion).
     - Grouping related content like chapters in a book or different parts of a webpage.

2. **`<article>` Tag**:
   - The `<article>` tag represents a complete, self-contained composition in a document, page, application, or site.
   - It should be able to stand alone and be independently distributable (like a newspaper article or a blog post).
   - Use `<article>` for content that can be syndicated or shared separately.
   - Examples of appropriate use:
     - Blog posts, news articles, forum posts, or product descriptions.
     - Any content that is a complete piece of information on its own.
